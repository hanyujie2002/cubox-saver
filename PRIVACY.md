# Cubox Saver Chrome Extension Privacy Policy

_Effective Date: January 17, 2025_

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your personal information in relation to your use of the Cubox Saver Google Chrome extension.

## Information Collection

The Cubox Saver Google Chrome Extension does not collect any personal information from users. However, it makes requests to the Cubox API to collect the URL and title of the current tab into your Cubox account. This involves the transmission of current tab url and title data but does not gather, store, or transmit any personal information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, or location. Since no personal data is collected, none of your data is sold to third parties.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy, and the "Effective Date" above will be updated. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

By using the Cubox Saver Google Chrome Extension, you signify your consent and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using the Cubox Saver Google Chrome Extension.

## Feedback
